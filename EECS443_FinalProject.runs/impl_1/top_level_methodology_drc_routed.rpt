2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell active_seg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) BTNL_state_reg/CLR, BTNR_state_reg/CLR, data_reg[0]/CLR, data_reg[10]/CLR,
data_reg[11]/CLR, data_reg[12]/CLR, data_reg[13]/CLR, data_reg[14]/CLR,
data_reg[15]/CLR, data_reg[16]/CLR, data_reg[17]/CLR, data_reg[18]/CLR,
data_reg[19]/CLR, data_reg[1]/CLR, data_reg[20]/CLR
